// Variables are containers for storing data values in JavaScript. They are declared using var, let, or const. Variables can hold various types of data, including primitives and objects.

// Primitives are basic data types in JavaScript that are immutable and directly represent a single value. There are six primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol. Primitives are passed by value.

let name = "John"; // string
let age = 25; // number
let isActive = true; // boolean
let person = null; // null
let status; // undefined
let uniqueId = Symbol(); // symbol
